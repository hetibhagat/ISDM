# Information System Development Methodologies

 ## **1. Outline the objectives of the project and define the problem (Steps 1 & 2 of Design Thinking Methodology).**

#### Define problems within current system:
1)	The lack of knowlegde to handle an information system to manage the CMC in terms of handling call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls, assisting RMs in serving their end-customers and matching RMs and end- customer profiles.
2)	The system operation is complicated by the varying number and nature of holiday packages offered by the travel company. 
3)	The call flow rate is sub purr due to the lack of performance based matching of RMs to Customers.
4)	The System does not match RM profiles based on performance in selling thus customers are not served efficiently and effectively. 
-> System does not use Skill matcher between customer and RMs profile. 
5)	The service being provided to end customers is not of quality which resulted in loss of potential buyers for outbound calls. 
6)	The inbound call costs are high due to long call-handling time. 
7)	Customers may experience delays and long wait times to be directed to a RM during busy periods. 

#### Objectives of the New System: 

1)	To improve the operation of the in-house call management centre (CMC)
2)	Provide improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls. 
3)	To improve call flow rate, match customers based on RM performance and product knowledge. 
4)	To increase the chance to achieve a sale or provide better service, RM will use matching techniques such as; segmenting customers into social, cultural and behavioural segments. 
5)	The system will adjust according to RMs subsequent performance in selling packages and in serving customers effectively and efficiently.
6)	Outbound calls need to be optimised by providing the RM with an effective guideline and script, crafted to help create the best user experience for the customer. 
->	Create a target list for RM based on skill & profile.
7)	Minimise inbound call costs by reducing per-call handling time
->	Rank customers according to their propensity to purchase using a scale of 1-10 Serve those with highest likelihood of buying first
8)	To reduce customer waiting time during busy periods, an interactive voice response unit is used until the first available RM. 
9)	Calls that are received by RMs are based on skill levels and best match.





## **2. Identify stakeholders.**
1) Travel company clients 
2) Customers 
3) Relationship Managers
4) Human Resources Team
5) IT team 


## **3. Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective.**

***Our current system cannot match appropriate clients and RMs resulting in an inefficient use of time and sub-par experience
for the customer. We have approached this problem by identifying each relevant aspect in the following ways.***

### **Empathy:**
>Inbound customer calls are enduring long wait times and being mismatched with inappropriate customer representatives.
Customers receiving cold calls are not being matched with a suitable RM

### **Define:**
>Customers are those that call into the travel company or receive out-bound sales calls. RMs are managers that interact with the customers 
either in a sales or support role. We require a system that that grades RMs according to proper metrics and matches them to 
appropriate customers.
>
>The company will also benefit from this as it will not only increase sales but also increase productivity 
in their work via efficient use of time from RMs.

### **Idea**:
>A system that matches RMs to suitable customers to minimise inbound call waiting times, 
maximise sales for out-bound calls and gives an overall improved customer experience
>
>We will do this by first grading RMs via use of a questionaire and then subsequently adjusting call-flows to best leverage
the skills and experience of each RM to provide the most efficient experience. Each subsequent call is then scored by call duration and
outcome to inform future matching for call-flows


## **4.Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum you have used to carry out the procedure. In your explanation, ensure that you outline activities from Scrum that you use.**
>For our travel company we have decided to develop an information system using Scrum mainly as our agile methodology. Scrum is an agile process in which it assumes the development process is complicated and unpredictable. This is advantageous in our scenario as in-house call centres can be uncertain due to customers cancelling their tickets or having a long wait time. Compared to other traditional methods the requirements are not fully understood from the beginning and can become an issue later on when new tools and objectives are introduced. 
Hence scrum provides the visibility needed for Relationship managers to effectively communicate with potential customers. Having the assistance of an information system which matches RMs skills and customer profiles creates an environment where teams are able to act autonomously without the need of a manager and are able to organise their own work. 
>
>Through implementing Scrum, teams are able to address the problem and issue a solution together. Each member of the group is a necessity to the solution as they are expected to carry out the completion of a product. Thus having the ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment according to feedback allows for a high level of cooperation, productivity and communication. Scrum can be broken into three main focus points which include roles, events and artefacts. The three key roles in our case are Product Owner, Scrum master and Development team.
>
Product Owners are the projects key stakeholders, they are ultimately accountable for project backlogs and verifying increments of work. Having a product owner within scrum allows for faster decision making and clearer responsibilities. On the other hand Scrum masters have no authority over the product owner and development team. Hence the scrum master can be considered as a referee that ensures teams are following the practices and rules within the agile methodology. Scrum masters will also go out of their way to allow the team to perform better.
The development team is a cross functional group that delivers their work in increments called “Sprinits”. They work autonomously without authority besides following scrum rules. Hence they are responsible for their own work and performance. 
>
>During the developing phase, activities such as sprints are performed in cycles within the month. These sprints are delivered with functionality and includes documentations/coding which are of value to the customer. Sprints are always timeboxed, this means that teams have to be careful on how they manage their time and understand their work capacity without delaying the end date. To successfully implement sprints, scrum teams must first start with sprint planning as this defines the intention of the goal. During this time, product owners and teams will plan and decide what the following sprints are supposed to achieve. Product backlogs will help determine these realistic tasks and set it to be accomplished first. The other half of the planning phase is allocated for teams to decide how they want to develop a working plan which breaks down each feature into a set of tasks. When sprint planning has been completed, the scrum master will perform whatever is necessary to produce a high-level product towards the end goal.
Once sprints are completed it will end with two events, the first is a sprint review. The intention of this review is to inspect and test the following product that has been developed. During this activity important participants such as stakeholders, product owners, development teams and customers will give a critical review on the overall effort of the product. Scrum teams are then able to gain frequent feedback, presenting itself as an opportunity to inspect and modify the product. The final activity of scrum is the sprint retrospective, this opportunity is to inspect the processes rather than the product. All scrum members will come together and make a final discussion on what is working and not working whilst having scrum. Teams should be able to identify a number of improvements for the next sprint, since the whole cycle will repeat itself and create a new goal for teams to focus on.

## **5. List assumptions you have made in system analysis**
***Assumptions are inextricable nextricable parts of problem-solvingdue to limited knowledge, capacity and resources to:***
>+  Completely comprehend systems dynamics andcomplexity
>+  Exert full control over interactions and individual behaviours
>+  Ensure entirely that our solutions will sustain anyexternal or internal disturbance
For our information system, assumptions are those things you assume to be true for your system to be successful therefore the assumptions that were documented from the project are:
1) Budget: Estimated cost of the project may exceed the initial budget
  >+ A travel company want to improve their in-house Call Management Centre therefore o improve call flow rate, match customers based on RM performance and product knowledge.
  However not every customer is a potential customer or end-customer so it may increased call-flow rate but the overall cost day-to-day activity may increase.
  >+ A supporting tool is used to create customer profiles exists, Profiler Tool. We assume this to be outsourced 
2) Resources: Relationship Managers and Human Resource Team 
>+ The system will require lots of manpower in order to deal with each customer or the waiting time for customers will increase.
>+ Database to store customers profiles, and segmenting customers based on their postcodes and surnames.
>+	We assume the system will use a database to match between end- customers and RMs based on their profiles. It will match based on similar attributes such as language, age and sex.
3) Delivery: 
>+ System servers arrive configured as expected 
>+ Correct number of services arrive on target delivery date with no delays, waiting time.
>+	The questionnaire that the RMs complete is designed by the HR team. This is because HR is in charge of employee performance within team. 
>+	This also means when making outbound calls RMs will have customer details such as age, sex, culture, language proficiency, experience and product knowledge. 


## **7. Discuss the competitive advantages might be gained in developing the new information system.Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if its information system project fails.**

>There are many advantages that will be gained from developing this new information system. These advantages are going to be beneficial for not only the company but its stakeholders as well. 
>
>The company’s main goal is to maximise profits and achieve customer satisfaction. This new information system (IS) allows that as it improves productivity within every department of the company. Relationship Managers (RMs) performance is accelerated as the system matches them to their customers, this makes it easier for them to achieve sales. Also this IS generates a script to help the RMs whilst talking to the customer which increases chances of sales as scripts are written to entice the customer into making a purchase. This also makes calls more effective and straight to the point which means time spent on call by the RM will be less and inturn this reduces call costs. The HR team is focused on improving employee performance and this system allows them to view this via a ‘skill score’. HR can view performance of RMs by analysing their scores from each call. This allows HR team to better understand and implement strategies of how to improve performance of their staff, leading to maximising company profits. 
>
>Company stakeholders such as customers and travel company clients also benefit from this new IS. Due to the feature of matching attributes of RMs to customers, customers will be more satisfied, example if a customer is struggling to explain their situation in English and the RM can speak their mother tongue, the RM can talk to them in that language and help them sort their issues making the customer feel pleased. This skill matching makes the calls more effective which means the time customers spend on call is reduced and their problems are solved more easily, increasing customer satisfaction. The system generated scripts also are beneficial to customers as they provide better customer experience. The voice response feature in the new IS system will also benefit the customers as it will reduce their wait time. The benefits for travel company clients are very similar, there wait times are also reduced by the system. 
>
>Conclusively, the new information system is of much benefit as it reduces company costs, maximises company sales and improves customer satisfaction. Hence this company will gain a competitive advantage over other Call management centres.  

 
### **Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if its information system project fails** 

>Many problems will occur for the business if its information system fails. The operations of the company will not be as organised as they are now. This will lead to loss of productivity within staff. Example if RM’s don’t get the script the chances of sales will decease and this may demotivate them and result in lower work productivity. Also, not having matching scripts and skill matchers will increase the inbound call costs as RMs will take longer to solve customer problems. This also creates two other negative effects; as customer aren’t being served effectively and the call-handling time is long they will feel less satisfaction with the company’s customer service. This will create a high risk of generating loss of sales. 
Conclusively, the company will loss it competitive advantage. 


### **Reflection**

Reflections & ‘How might we statements.’

>1.	Customers are having a poor experience due to long wait-times and ineffective targeting of sales calls. 
>
>-	How might we improve wait times?
>-	How might we improve customer experience?
>
>-	We can train more staff
>
>-	We can outsource some calls.
>
>-	Move some tools online to remove the need to call, reducing load

Using the above information, we can assume that the system doesn’t allow for either the outsourcing of calls nor the development of online tools. These bounds are important as, while not explicitly stated, help create a more focused system. The training of staff, whilst feasible, can be assumed to be beyond the scope of this project as it is a HR matter.

>2.	Relationship managers are the staff members interfacing with the customers to either manage incoming calls or making outgoing sales calls. As per the POV statement they wish to do the best job possible whilst experiencing job satisfaction.
>
>-	How might we manage calls better?
>-	How might be recognised for good work?
>
>-	We can provide additional training
>
>-	We can monitor calls to gauge skills
>
>-	We have feedback surveys

Call management can be improved by more focused training; however, this does not tackle the variable of the customer themselves. People are varied and without proper curation and routing this will remain an issue. For our system, we must assume that the provided ‘Profiler Tool’ is effective for the curation and that it isn’t so invasive that it detracts from the customer experience. 
Surveys are an effective way to receive feedback regarding RM skill and handling of calls but we must also make the leap that the answers will be answered accurately by the customer and that they won’t simply be skipped.



>3.	The I.T team are those employees that are responsible for system maintenance and for expansion when necessary.
>
>-	How might we ensure a stable system?
>-	How might we ensure ease of maintenance and expansion?
>
>-	We can ensure stable hardware
>
>-	We can train staff appropriately
>
>-	We can develop the system using sound engineering practices

The training of the IT staff and the hardware involved are outside the prevue of this system, but we can assume that the staff are adequately trained and that the selected hardware is stable. Expansion may be an issue in the future thus we must take scalability into account when designing the system. We should also assume that the project will be conducted with sound engineering practices. 

>4.	Human Resources Staff will be responsible for the RM questionnaires, profiles and the performance during calls. Their main issues relate to the management of staff.
>
>-	How might we maintain accurate RM profiles?
>-	How might we have an effect questionnaire?
>
>-	Automated feedback and maintenance post-call
>
>-	Manual maintenance of profiles by HR staff
>
>-	Questionnaires for RMs revised on a schedule

The automation of RM profiles, whilst effective, isn’t explicitly tackled in the case study. We can assume that this aspect of the system is not automatic and must be handled by HR staff. This is the more effective measure at this time as an, assumed, automated system may not be accurate. Whilst questionnaires themselves are explicitly addressed, the revision and improvement of this aspect is not. We can assume that HR staff will monitor questionnaires on a regular basis and update as needed.

>5.  The clients of the travel company, and consequently the CMC, are entities that have engaged the travel company in a support or sales capacity. They wish to make as many sales as possible as well as provide the best after-sales support possible.
>
>-	How might we improve sales?
>-	How might we provide adequate sales support to their customers?
>
>-	More sales by knowing the customer via existing information.
>
>-	Improve support by improving customer experience.

The sales aspect of this can be addressed using the mentioned “Profiler tool” which segments customers using existing database information. This will help us target only relevant products during sales calls. This tool also ties in with after sales-support as it can also help the system match the customer profile to the best suited RM. We must assume that this tool is both accurate and fit for purpose if the rest of our system is to work.
