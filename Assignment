Questions
1. Outline the objectives of the project and define the problem (Steps 1 & 2 of Design Thinking Methodology).

Define problems within current system:
1)	The lack of knowlegde to handle an information system to manage the CMC in terms of handling call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls, assisting RMs in serving their end-customers and matching RMs and end- customer profiles.
2)	The system operation is complicated by the varying number and nature of holiday packages offered by the travel company. 
3)	The call flow rate is sub purr due to the lack of performance based matching of RMs to Customers.
4)	The System does not match RM profiles based on performance in selling thus customers are not served efficiently and effectively. 
-> System does not use Skill matcher between customer and RMs profile. 
5)	The service being provided to end customers is not of quality which resulted in loss of potential buyers for outbound calls. 
6)	The inbound call costs are high due to long call-handling time. 
7)	Customers may experience delays and long wait times to be directed to a RM during busy periods. 

Objectives of the New System: 

1)	To improve the operation of the in-house call management centre (CMC)
2)	Provide improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls. 
3)	To improve call flow rate, match customers based on RM performance and product knowledge. 
4)	To increase the chance to achieve a sale or provide better service, RM will use matching techniques such as; segmenting customers into social, cultural and behavioural segments. 
5)	The system will adjust according to RMs subsequent performance in selling packages and in serving customers effectively and efficiently.
6)	Outbound calls need to be optimised by providing the RM with an effective guideline and script, crafted to help create the best user experience for the customer. 
->	Create a target list for RM based on skill & profile.
7)	Minimise inbound call costs by reducing per-call handling time
->	Rank customers according to their propensity to purchase using a scale of 1-10 Serve those with highest likelihood of buying first
8)	To reduce customer waiting time during busy periods, an interactive voice response unit is used until the first available RM. 
9)	Calls that are received by RMs are based on skill levels and best match.





2. Identify stakeholders.
1) Travel company clients 
2) Customers 
3) Relationship Managers
4) Human Resources Team
5) IT team 





3. Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective.

Our current system cannot match appropriate clients and RMs resulting in an inefficient use of time and sub-par experience
for the customer. We have approached this problem by identifying each relevant aspect in the following ways; 
// problem analysis stage is over, talk about new system not old be postive not negative 

Empathy:
Inbound customer calls are enduring long wait times and being mismatched with inappropriate customer representatives.
Customers receiving cold calls are not being matched with a suitable RM

Define:
Customers are those that call into the travel company or receive out-bound sales calls. RMs are managers that interact with the customers 
either in a sales or support role. We require a system that that grades RMs according to proper metrics and matches them to 
appropriate customers.

The company will also benefit from this as it will not only increase sales but also increase productivity 
in their work via efficient use of time from RMs.

Idea:
A system that matches RMs to suitable customers to minimise inbound call waiting times, 
maximise sales for out-bound calls and gives an overall improved customer experience

We will do this by first grading RMs via use of a questionaire and then subsequently adjusting call-flows to best leverage
the skills and experience of each RM to provide the most efficient experience. Each subsequent call is then scored by call duration and
outcome to inform future matching for call-flows


4.Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum you have used to carry out the procedure. 
In your explanation, ensure that you outline activities from Scrum that you use.

5. List assumptions you have made in the systems analysis.

6. Document your proposed workproducts and models.

7. Discuss the competitive advantages might be gained in developing the new information
system. Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if its information
system project fails
